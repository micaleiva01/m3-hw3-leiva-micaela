            <h2>How the band started</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>They initially met at University College London, calling themselves Big Fat Noises and changing to Starfish, before settling on the current name.</p>   
                    <p>On 27 June 1999, Coldplay made their first appearance at the Glastonbury Festival in the New Bands Tent. They later recorded The Blue Room, which had 5,000 copies pressed and sold to the public.[28] Its sessions were originally meant for Parachutes (2000), but became tumultuous due to Martin having heated discussions regarding Champion's abilities as a drummer.</p>
